Hi, thanks for checking out my repository.

This is a news homepage/landing page. A project replication from www.frontendmentor.io.

I recreated this project to hone my javascript and responsiveness skills. This project was completed entirely in HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.

The project's Featurs.

1. Responsiveness: The page is responsive on whatever device that you view it on. From smartphones to tablets to iPads.
2. When a user clicks on a certain tab, the Nav bar displays active stats.
3. The navigation bar vanishes on mobile.
4. When in mobile mode, you can open and close the sidebar using an icon.

Below is a screenshot of the interface.
